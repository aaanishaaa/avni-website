                            hosted option that runs on
                            the Cloud and can configure a system for you within a week. Please use the Contact Us form at the bottom of this page to reach out to us. If

                        <h4>How much would an implementation of Avni cost?</h4>
                        <p>Avni is open source so there is no license cost for the software. But there are other costs for - implementation, hosting and ongoing user
                            support.
                            Implementation is usually one time activity of configuring application as per your needs on the platform. When you want to start using the
                            application
                            then you will need hosting and perhaps ongoing user support. In order to understand the details of these cost please contact us
                            avnipartnerships@samanvayfoundation.org - as the cost depends on the complexity of the implementation, number of users and workloads.

                            Quite likely you will need to run all three components - server, database and reporting platform. AWS Cognito is used from the AWS cloud. If
                            you plan to run of the servers on a single machine you would need a server with at least 8 GB RAM and 4 core CPU (or vCPU) for production
                            environment. If you plan to run them separately then you will need to set up a server of 2 core and 4 GB RAM each (reporting platform could do
                            with a slightly lower configuration). This excludes backups and replication, which you can setup according to your needs. Typical running cost
                            for you on AWS infrastructure with reserved instances could be around - 12,000 rupees a month (excluding the cost of people involved in
                            managing the system).</p>
