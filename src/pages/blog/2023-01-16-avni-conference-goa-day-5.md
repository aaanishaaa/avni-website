### Wave se darr nhi lagta, ___ se lagta hai….

Amidst gushing waves, vast blue sky we had this mesmerizing stay at Varca Le Palms beach resort, Goa. No other location could have been better to have our Avni 2023 Conference.

Since it was the last day of the conference, this was our last chance to get drenched in the sea, so we all decided to go into the sea that morning and we enjoyed being there together a lot!

Avni team members and its NGO Partners were the conference attendees. Around 12 NGO partners were invited to this two day conference. By the second day of the conference we all had enough interactions amongst each other and developed a feeling of being part of a social ecosystem where Avni was the connecting element.

We all started the session by singing - “Itni Shakti Hamein Dena Data…”, a prayer.

The key agenda that everyone was looking forward to on the second day of the conference was Data session - How different organizations retrieve data from Avni and its Roadmap for 2023. Being part of the team made me feel that ultimately, sharing the roadmap and reviewing it together strengthened the relationship between Avni team and the NGO partners by providing them a means to understand, collaboratively shape and plan future solutions.

### Data session - How different organizations retrieve data from Avni

Also, Arjun bhaiya presented the Tableau dashboard that was created for RWB Niti last year, he also specified the pros and cons of using Tableau.

The road map for 2023 included various aspects such as capability, robustness, ease of use and team efficiency. There are few major features that most of the NGO partners are looking forward to such as - access control in Data entry app, AWS dependency removal, improving reports performance, admin UI for updating/uploading location properties and drugs and so on..

### NGO talks
The remaining day was filled with NGO talks from Lend A Hand India (LAHI),Piramal Foundation, Shelter Associates and Azim Premji Foundation (APF) who couldn’t do it on the first day. These NGO talks gave us a broader context on the work that each of this organization is doing or planning along with how Avni is getting used and the impact of it. We missed a talk from Save the Children, Assam Tea plantation as Sharmishta had some urgent calls to attend. I would have personally loved to hear from her as I have been working on this and had visited them during the start of the year itself.

APF was rolled out within 2 months of duration and has multiple feature requests and changes from the ground.

### Talks from Project Tech4Dev and Glific
The Tech4dev team had their sprint starting from the 16th, so we got a chance to listen to a one hour session driven by their different team members.It was quite informative and it helped the Avni family to understand the complete picture of how and what all The Project Tech4dev do.

She also highlighted key features of Glific - Easy to launch and scale, No code platform and have a strong documentation for the same. Glific is one of the software partners in the Tech4Dev project as it works for non-profit organizations. The picture shows some statistics of the same.
This was followed by a demo from Mahalakshme on the Avni Glific integration that Avni has been working on. Many of NGO partners found to be very interesting and had queries especially came on the consent part.
Sanjeev and Siddhant from the project Tech4Dev team gave us insight on Development Data Platform initiative where they have been working on building a system that allows NGO to offload their data management. Under this they provide analysis dashboard and visualizations.Also, they would be piloting this before end of year in partnership with IDInsight and The Agency Fund.


### Icebreakers
Apart from the serious sessions and talks, one interesting game that we played to start the post lunch session where everybody was supposed to repeat the line with their own fears - Wave se darr nhi lagta, ___ se lagta hai!! One of them was -

“Lehro se darr nhi lagta, chehro se lagta hai” - Akash Patki

We had such icebreakers and fun games within these two days which made everyone comfortable and interactive during the whole conference and helped us get to know each other better!


### Conference comes to closure with Retro
We concluded the Avni conference with a round of retro from all the participants.The retro points which came during this were jolly, optimistic and emotional ones too..
Few major retro points that came were - It was good to know how other NGOs or organizations have been using Avni and its impact, got to know difference between a feature and configuration change, came to know various tech features - reports, integrations and data, got a feeling that we all are part of a social ecosystem, nice that we had a roadmap discussion and many more.
