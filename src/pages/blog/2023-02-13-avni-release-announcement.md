Release 3.37 is now live. This release includes App Stability, Whatsapp (Glific) Integration, Feature Enhancements and Bug fixes. 
 
Please note that this is a major release.


## Notable Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Performance bug fixes
One of the major changes that we had done in [last release](https://avniproject.org/blog/2023-01-13-avni-release-announcement/) was packages upgrade in the field app. Even though we had done a lot of testing and stabilisation, after the release rollout users started reporting performance issues. So, one of the major priorities for us in this release was to stabilise the application and bring back the experience of the users to pre-package upgrade levels. With significant efforts we have been able to make good progress. Slowness reported in various areas have been fixed. There is still scope for improvement and fine tuning and we would continue to do that in subsequent releases.

Check this [before performance improvement video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROqesiF_X4RgJ2DMmBq-UQZVVwAjKYtt/view?usp=share_link) and [after performance improvement video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aXSQ8fQOifRMB3O22ms6Oa68-CiBA0yV/view?usp=share_link) to get an idea of the performance improvement made.
