### New features

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Repeatable question group
Now you can mark a Question group repeatable which allows user to repeat and fill same questions again. User can add the 
same set of questions, or remove any set that is filled by mistake. [Read more about repeatable question group](https://avni.readme.io/docs/repeatable-question-group)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Autocomplete in location form element if there are more than 30 elements
This is the UI change done on mobile app where user can now search for a location using it's name if location
count increases 30. This will give better user experience as user don't have to scroll and search for a location in 
long list.

### Encounter data type
Similar to subject data type now implementers can link encounters in the form using new Encounter data type.
All the configurations related to how the encounter name should appear, and which encounter type to take 
can be done while creating the concept. [Read more about the supported data types in avni](https://avni.readme.io/docs/concepts)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Documentation in Avni
Now you can create custom documentation in Avni. Documentation supports rich text and can be written in different
languages supported by an organisation. Right now you can also link a particular documentation to a form element and 
it'll show up in the mobile app. This is useful where more context is required for any question. 
[Read here to know more about configuring the documentation](https://avni.readme.io/docs/documentation)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Timed questions
Questions can be timed in Avni. If you want user to fill some set of questions after a particular time then you can mark the 
page as timed page and specify the time when the questions in the page should be visible. You also set the stay time 
which forces user to fill all those questions in the mentioned time frame. [More about the timed questions in Avni documentation](https://avni.readme.io/docs/timed-questions)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Colourful form element groups
Now you can make form filling more interesting by giving relevant colours to the page headers. Background and text colour 
can be chosen for a form element group and it'll show the page name in that color while filling up the form and in the observation table.

### No subject Indicators in offline dashboards
More information can be displayed on the offline dashboard cards. Till now it only supported the count based on the query written,
but now implementer can pass `primaryValue`, `secondaryValue`, and `lineListFunction` separately. [Read more about configuring the custom 
dashboard](https://avni.readme.io/docs/offline-reports)
