Major Release 4.0.0 is now live, it includes the following modifications to the Avni application


![Fine-grained access control in Avni](/img/Access control in Avni.png)

### Fine-grained access control in the Avni application
We have always wanted to have fine-grained controls in the Avni application. This would enable organisations to grant users privileges for specific functionalities without exposing other critical operations. Ex: Allow a user to upload a transactional data file without providing him access to the "App Designer" capabilities.
Read more about "Access Control" [here](https://avni.readme.io/docs/access-control#privileges).

### Major enhancements to the integration-service module
We have added support for the following capabilities in integration-service
- Multi-tenancy for every organisation-specific module
- Meta-data migration for an organisation across different tenants of the same module

Check out the Avni [integration design and developer guide here](https://avni.readme.io/docs/integration-developer-guide).

### Major enhancements in the ETL application
We have added support to process data of the following types in our ETL application:
- GroupSubjects (Household as well as Generic GroupSubjects)
- RepeatableQuestionGroups
- SyncTelemetry
- Users

Read full documentation of Avni ETL service [here](https://avni.readme.io/docs/etl-schema-and-reporting).

### Minor bug fixes
There have also been minor bug fixes and UI/UX improvements. Please see the component release notes linked at the end for more information.
