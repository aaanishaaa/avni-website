## _khamma Ghani !!_


It was my first-time experience being part of a team offsite Sprint after joining Avni. I am very grateful to the organizer for conducting this kind of program.


## Getting to Know My Teammates Better

The very first, session was a team bonding session __'A day in the life of everyone'__. In this session, all team members described their daily routine in brief. From this session, I was able to discover each participant's strengths and skills. It paved the way for a friendly and inclusive atmosphere in the future.

## Avni Functionalities

This session was arranged by a senior team member. They gave a brief explanation of the functionalities of the Product and the tools and technology we used. It was a very informative session and helped me to understand the working of Avni.

## Field Visit

I visited an NGO called __Aajeevika Bureau__ with my teammates. It was my first experience with an NGO. It helped me to understand the workings at the ground level and how Avni will help.

## Fun Activities and Place Visit

Before each session of the sprint, we had fun activities. These activities created a joyful atmosphere. I was particularly happy to learn the languages and food habits of the culturally diverse participants. Overall I believe we gained respect, empathy, and sensitivity toward each other.
