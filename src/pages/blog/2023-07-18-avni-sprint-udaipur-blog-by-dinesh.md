# Avni Conference, Udaipur, July 2023
## About the Place:
Exploring North India for the first time was a truly memorable experience. Not only did I have the opportunity to witness the region's breathtaking beauty, but I also had the chance to delve into the culinary delights of Rajasthan. Every dish I tried had its own distinct flavors, which showcased the rich cultural heritage of the region. It was a delightful journey of discovery, immersing myself in the local food scene and savoring the diversity of flavors that North India has to offer.
## Overview of Sprint:
During our sprint, we had the opportunity to engage with NGOs such as BHS and Ajeevika, and learn about their impactful work in the field. It was inspiring to witness the dedication and passion of the individuals involved, as they tirelessly worked towards making a positive difference in the lives of others.
Additionally, we had the chance to interact with professionals from the IT sector who showcased their innovative projects. It was fascinating to see how they were utilizing cutting-edge technologies like ChatGPT to integrate them into their products. The seamless integration of this new technology opened up exciting possibilities for enhancing user experiences and providing more efficient and personalized solutions.
## Sprint planning:
Working remotely has its perks, but nothing compares to the opportunity of finally meeting and connecting with the team in person. Our time together was not only productive but also filled with enjoyable sessions that brought us closer as a cohesive unit.

As a team, we dedicated valuable discussions to assess our current progress, identify areas for improvement, and outline our future plans. These conversations allowed us to align our goals, ensuring that we were on the same page regarding our development trajectory and the path we envisioned for our collective success.
## First Day:
Throughout the event, each day brought its own special moments that I would like to highlight. On the first day, we kicked things off with a lighthearted water polo game that set a joyful tone for the rest of the day. Later, we engaged in a fun session of Pictionary, which further strengthened our bond as a team.

One of the standout experiences was the "How Do I Start My Day" session held at 9 a.m. It offered valuable insights into how team members plan and structure their day, giving us all practical tips to enhance our productivity and well-being.
## Second Day:
The second day was dedicated to an enlightening NGO session. We had the privilege of learning about the vital role that funders play in supporting the work of NGOs, ensuring that essential needs are met for the people they serve.

Additionally, we embarked on a memorable boat ride on the picturesque Pichola Lake, an experience that no visitor to Udaipur should miss, especially at night when the scenery is simply breathtaking.

An excursion to the local market allowed us to explore traditional Rajasthani clothing and crafts. I was particularly captivated by the unique sarees and shirts, showcasing the rich artistic heritage of Rajasthan.
## Third Day:
The third day was filled with informative sessions by Tech4dev, who shared their insights into product development and its practical applications.

Following that, we embarked on a culinary adventure, exploring the flavors of Rajasthan at Khama Ghanni Hotel, located near the lake. I highly recommend trying the famous dish "Daal Batti Churma" as it provides a delightful culinary experience that will satisfy your taste buds with its unique flavors. Just remember not to overindulge, as a small serving is more than enough to leave you feeling satisfied.
