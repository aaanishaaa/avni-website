Patch Release 3.37.16 is now live. This release includes minor code changes to
- make "Show total count in MyDashboard on filter by Program and its Encounters or General-Encounters" a configurable functionality
- make Entity Approval screen scrollable with minor alignment and styling fixes

### Details about "Show total count in MyDashboard on filter by Program and its Encounters or General-Encounters" a configurable functionality
In the last patch release we had made changes to show totals only on applying program filters but not on applying any program-encounter or General-Encounter filters.

In-order to show totals even when we have selected programs or encounters, please inform Avni implementation team to update the configuration for your organisation.
Once done, all users in your organisation will be shown the "Total" card in "Registration Overview section", even when they apply filter on Programs or encounters. 

## Entity Approval screen made scrollable with minor alignment and styling fixes
