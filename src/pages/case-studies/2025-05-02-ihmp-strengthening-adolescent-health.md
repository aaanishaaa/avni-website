## Introduction

Over the last 45 years, the Institute of Health Management Pachod (IHMP) – a non-profit organisation – has been at the forefront of addressing critical public health issues faced by disadvantaged communities in India. Since its establishment in 1979, IHMP has positively impacted over seven million people, focusing on maternal and neonatal health, child health, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, and adolescent development.

A major focus over the last 25 years has been on safeguarding and transforming the lives of vulnerable adolescent girls in rural and urban slum communities. IHMP’s initiatives have reached over 127,000 married adolescent girls, significantly increasing contraceptive use, delaying first pregnancies, and reducing maternal and child mortality. Additionally, IHMP has provided life skills education to 103,000 unmarried girls, delaying marriage age from 14.5 to 18 years, while also engaging 8,600 boys and young men to promote gender-equitable behaviors.

## Problem Statement & Intervention 1: Addressing Health Risks Among Adolescent Girls

The urban slums of Pune presented several public health challenges:

- **High Health Risks**: Early pregnancies led to increased adolescent deaths and maternal and neonatal morbidity.
- **Limited Access to Services**: Young women had little to no access to sexual and reproductive health services.
- **Behavioral Barriers**: Lack of awareness hindered effective use of healthcare facilities.

**IHMP’s Integrated Reproductive and Sexual Health and Family Planning Project** focused on:

- Delaying early pregnancies and increasing family planning awareness.
- Improving access to antenatal and postnatal care services.
- Providing life skills education to prevent early marriages.
- Engaging young men to shift gender norms.

The intervention relied on a **community-based model**, led by ASHA workers through regular home visits, paper-based registers, and monthly micro-plans. This manual model laid a strong foundation but revealed limitations as the program scaled.

## Problem Statement & Intervention 2: Improving Efficiency in Healthcare Delivery Through Digital Tools

Despite successful interventions, service delivery inefficiencies emerged:

- **Manual Paperwork**: Led to frequent human errors, missed visits, and delayed interventions.
- **Frontline Worker Burden**: Excessive paperwork left less time for community engagement.

To overcome these, IHMP adopted the **Avni platform**, digitizing healthcare delivery across urban slums and rural villages.

Key features of the Avni app:

- **Visit Scheduling and Micro-Planning**: Automated schedules based on real-time health assessments, prioritizing high-risk cases.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Supervisors track field activities instantly, identifying and addressing gaps.
- **Job Aid for ASHAs**: The app supports symptom assessments and action guidance during visits.
- **Counseling and Referrals**: It also facilitates real-time counseling, generates referral notes, and supports effective linkage to health services.

## Impact and Outcomes

The digital intervention led to significant improvements:

- **Behavioral Changes**: Increased maternal service utilization and contraceptive use.
- **Quantitative Gains**: From 2021–2024, YMW (young married women) monthly visit coverage rose by 21.4 percentage points.
- **Efficiency Gains**: ASHA workers reported higher job satisfaction, reduced paperwork, and better income through performance-based incentives.
- **Monitoring and Coverage**: Real-time data allowed timely corrective actions, improving service coverage.

## Conclusion

IHMP’s project in Pune’s slums shows how digital tools like the Avni app can drive major improvements in public health interventions. Through early identification of health needs, real-time monitoring, and effective counseling, IHMP strengthened healthcare delivery and contributed to the holistic development of vulnerable communities. This success reaffirms IHMP’s mission to address gender inequities and improve health outcomes for women and children in disadvantaged settings.
